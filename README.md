# bt3-gsc-bgm-detector
 A datamining tool made in Eclipse, that takes a GSC (Dragon History scenario file) 
 and displays which songs are used, during which cutscenes.  
 
 To ensure that it works, the project comes with the GSC file used for What-If Saga's "Galaxy Battle" scenario.
 
## Usage/Preview

## Known Issues
* As of now, this program is command-line only.
* I cannot get a proper runnable JAR release of the program because of certain issues with Eclipse's export feature.
  Because of that, there are no download/build instructions provided. Guilty as charged. (at this point I really really should)
